#tank not only can move forward
#it also can rotate
#with "left()" and "right()" commands

#here we ask it to move a bit forward,
#to turn left and move a step more

#commands are executed in the same order
#they are written - surprise, yeah? :)

forward()
left()
forward()

#switch to next level when you are ready!
