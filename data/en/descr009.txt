This is a puzzle!<br/><br/>

There are several stars, seemingly placed in chaos - however we can find
a simple rule which allows to collect them with very simple code.<br/><br/>

Note we also introduce "for .. in" loop here which in combination with "range(x)"
function makes the program repeat actions exactly "x" times.
