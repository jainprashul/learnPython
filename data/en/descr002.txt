Let us try another instructions - for rotating tank left and right.
Try to "Run" it and then add more commands to move it further
and also to rotate it right (perhaps few times).<br/>
Regard the rules:<br/>
- place each command on separate line<br/>
- start each command at the beginning of line<br/>
- do not do typos and do not forget parentheses.
