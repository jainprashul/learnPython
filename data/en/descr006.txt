Sometimes we want to group several commands into one block and
reuse it again. One of the recipes for this is to put them into "function".
Note the syntax in the example below:<br/>
- we start with "def" keyword<br/>
- we put parentheses after function name (which could be any) and a colon<br/>
- then we put commands into its "body", indenting them with 4 spaces from line start
<br/><br>
To call this function we put it in our program just as any other command
(they are functions also, by the way). Do not forget parentheses.
