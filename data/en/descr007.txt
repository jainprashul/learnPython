We can repeat commands also by enclosing them into "while" loop. We use
condition to determine when the loop should stop. For such condition let's
call "look_ahead()" function and test there is no wall.<br/>
The "while" loop repeats while condition is true. Symbol '!=' is "not equals"
so the whole condition reads "while look_ahead not equals wall".

Take care of correct syntax, please! Computers do not like typos!
