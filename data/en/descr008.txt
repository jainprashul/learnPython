Another useful structure is "if". It works similar to "while", but the commands inside
are executed only once, if the condition is correct.<br/>
We also can put "whiles" and "ifs" inside each other (adding 4 spaces to indentation
each time).<br/>
In this exercise we use "if" to check with the help of call to "look_below()" function
if there is a star under the tank, so we can collect it. Note the '==' operator which
means "equals". So the condition is "if look_below equals star"...
