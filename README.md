#Code Robots

Here is a prototype of an educational game, designed to teach basics of python programming.

We have a set of exercises in form of puzzles, where small tank should be driven through the field to collect prizes.
The tank is robotic so it is controlled by the python code which should be written following the instructions and examples.
